# Financial News Analysis

In this project for my nlp class, I use [FinBERT](https://github.com/ProsusAI/finBERT) to answer my questions:
1. How easily can you automate reading and analyzing the news with nlp?
2. Is there a significant correlation between the news sentiment and the performance of the stock?
